## Overview 

A fridge management web application that helps you organise your fridge and track your favourite recipes. 

44% of UK household food waste is due to food going out of date in fridges. This app aims to help reduce food waste by managing the fridge more effectively. It uses generative AI to recommend recipes based on expiring items, leveraging a database of recipes collected from [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes). It also recommends ingredients to buy based on your favourite recipes, optimising your grocery shopping process.

## Application Workflow

This app was built for the Palantir 2024 Winter Fellowship, so it leverages the Palantir AIP platform to create and maintain the backend application and uses the OSDK Client to interact with the backend. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, and the styling is done with CSS Modules.
